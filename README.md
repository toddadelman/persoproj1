#Todd Personal Project

  "3X"

"Time is NOT $!- Productivity is the new $$"

---Users and Use---

--> My project is a productivity tracking application.
For anyone - but in this instance its focused on the new Jr. Developer (me!) getting oneself focused on "quality of time" rather than "amount of time" devoted to a task.

--> User will input 3 most important tasks for the day- prioritize!
Assign a time allocated to the task(s) then submit when ready.

--> OnClick --> timer initiates

 -->When time set elapses - user prompted to rate the overall session on the 3 key productivity metrics.
Metrics are stored for each task, each day and week and presented in a visual format


 End result: giving user a visual represetation of peak productivity bands in the course of a working day/week.
          : with that design ones daily routine around ideal energy and focused times during the day, 
          not 9 --> 5 but when your natural biorhythm works best for the individual.
